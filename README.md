# Lane_Departure_Warning_System
PBL5 project at Da Nang University of Technology. The project uses input data sets from dash cam images of the CULane data set. The data will then be processed using denoising and HoughLines algorithms to extract Finbra line features. From there, build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and use Tensorflow to train the model.
